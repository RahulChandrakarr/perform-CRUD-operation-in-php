# perform-CRUD-operation-in-php
In this project, I have created a web page that allows users to input their details, which are then saved into a MySQL database. The main objective of the project is to create a user-friendly web application that can efficiently store and manage user data using CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
